# Bamazon App

No HTML file for this project.

# Overview

In this project, an Amazon-like storefront was built using a database made through mySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes the stock from the store's inventory.

# Nodes Used
● <b>inquirer</b> to ask the user questions <br>
● <b>mysql2</b> to connect the javascript file to the mySQL database <br>
● <b>validator</b> to validate what the user types in <br>

# Installation
First thing that is required is the installation of each of the nodes above. Go into the terminal and type <br>
<b>'npm init -y'</b> <br>
into the folder that you would like to run this file in. After this is done, you can type <br>
<b>'npm install name-of-node-here'</b> or <b>'npm i name-of-node-here'</b> <br>
for each of the nodes above, excluding mysql2, to be able to run the javascript file.

# Usage
The first thing that the user will see upon opening the terminal and running the file with the command <b>node bamazonCustomer.js</b> is a list of items that our shop is selling at this time. <br>
